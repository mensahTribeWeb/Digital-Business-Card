## Overview

<!-- TODO: Add a screenshot of the live project. -->
    1. image.png
    2. I have gained the confidence to built components and containers to be rendered. I also practiced using react 17+ 
       1. importing React and reactDOM
       2. importing components
       3. mounting components to be rendered 
       4. how components allow for smoother app build
   
        
 **important** try to understand that importing react allows the the components to utilize jsx, while importing reactDom allow the jsx to be rendered in the DOM after being converted to JS.
